      <p id="intro-text">You're off on a wild outer space adventure! Somewhere in the galaxy Andromeda, floating among trillions of stars, you happen to run into another friendly COSMONAUT.<br><br>The Cosmonaut waves at you from his spaceship. "Friendly traveler!" he cries. "My spaceship is out of fuel! Can you help me?"<br><br>You explain to the cosmonaut that you would love to help, but you only have enough fuel to complete your own mission and get safely home.<br/><br/>"No, no," he says. "Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mr. Fun Guy. I am the captain of a spaceship that runs on a very different fuel: magical space mushrooms! And they are floating around us everywhere amongst the stars! But they are very hard to catch, and I can't leave my ship! Can you help me?"<br/><br/>Help Mr. Fun Guy fuel up by catching him some magic mushrooms. Click on them as they appear while you fly through space. If you find a magic mushroom, you'll earn a fuel point. When you earn enough points, you'll fill up his tank.
      <br><br>"One more thing!" says Mr. Fun Guy. "NOT ALL OF THE MUSHROOMS ARE MAGIC! Some are even poisonous. Be careful with those! They'll destroy my spaceship's engine, and I won't be able to go anywhere."
